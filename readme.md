#Guild and Commerce 2.0

This version of GnC is a port of the original mod to MC version 1.16.
There are two major reasons for creating GnC2.0 as a new project and not a continuation of the previous.  
First, MC code changes after 1.12 are significant, and forge is no exception.  These structural changes mean building from the ground up is the best course of action
Second, To improve performance, I am changing how data is stored from WSDs to MySQL databases.  This fundamental rework would also make updating the old version fruitless.

I currently have no self-imposed deadline for when I will be releasing a 1.16 version.  If you are interested in the mod, version 1.x is still fully supported for MC 1.12.
